// CAN THE TEST SUITE STILL FAIL?
//
// Every other gate here asks "is the code right". This one asks the question underneath it:
// IS ANYTHING STILL WATCHING. A suite that has quietly stopped covering a property goes green
// for exactly the same reason as a suite that is passing honestly, and there is no way to tell
// the two apart by looking at the green.
//
// It has happened across this kit more than once. anvil's Docker tests were SKIPPED for months
// — 11 pass, 0 fail, 9 skipped, green every run — while the tool was completely broken on
// Linux. lens's file walk swallowed .env files, and twenty green tests never saw it.
//
// So: break the code ON PURPOSE, in the exact places whose breakage would cost the most, and
// demand the suite goes RED. If it stays green, the canary is dead and this job fails — the
// test guarding that line has stopped guarding it, and you find out today rather than the
// morning after it mattered.
//
//   node scripts/mutants.mjs
//
// Each canary must have EXACTLY ONE anchor. An anchor that has drifted is a canary that
// silently stopped watching, so a missing or ambiguous anchor is a hard failure, never a skip.
