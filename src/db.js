// ── A READ MUST NOT CREATE THE THING IT IS READING ──────────────────────────────
//
// This module used to open the database AT IMPORT — mkdir, create the file, run the
// schema — so merely ASKING A QUESTION brought the store into existence. Run a search in
// someone's home directory and you left a .scout/ cache behind in it. And the empty store you
// just created then answered the question, confidently, with nothing:
//
//     — 0 hits —
//
// which an agent reads as "that is not in your reading", when the truth is that there was
// never anything there to look in. A tool should not litter, and it should not invent the
// evidence for its own answer.
//
// So: reads (get/all) open what is there and return NOTHING when there is nothing —
// they never create. Writes (run/writeDb) create, because a write is a statement of
// intent. `storeExists()` lets the caller tell the two apart and say so out loud.

  // 🔑 WAL LETS READERS AND A WRITER COEXIST. IT DOES NOTHING FOR TWO WRITERS.
  // Without busy_timeout the second writer does not WAIT for the lock — it fails INSTANTLY with
  // SQLITE_BUSY. Measured on cortex, whose store has exactly this shape: two agents writing at once
  // lost 45 of 60 writes ("database is locked"), a 75% failure rate. SQLite's default answer to
  // contention is to give up immediately, and a write that gives up is data that never existed —
  // on a kit built for MANY AGENTS sharing one store, that default is exactly the wrong one.
  //
  // AND busy_timeout DOES NOT SAVE THE OPEN ITSELF. `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL` needs a brief
  // exclusive lock and SQLite answers SQLITE_BUSY for it IMMEDIATELY rather than invoking the busy
  // handler — so the timeout that protects every later write does nothing for the call that sets it
  // up. Four processes starting on a fresh store lost a write EVERY round, always the first one.
  //
  // And the schema must go up ATOMICALLY: two processes opening a fresh store at the same instant
  // raced, one creating the file while the other opened it BEFORE the tables existed, and then every
  // call died with `no such table` — not a lock error, just a store that does not work.
